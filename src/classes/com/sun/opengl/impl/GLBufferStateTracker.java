/**
 * Tracks as closely as possible which OpenGL buffer object is bound
 * to which binding target in the current OpenGL context.
 * GLBufferStateTracker objects are allocated on a per-GLImpl basis,
 * which is basically identical to a per-OpenGL-context basis
 * (assuming correct usage of the GLImpl objects, which is checked by
 * the DebugGL). This class is used to verify that e.g. the vertex
 * buffer object extension is in use when the glVertexPointer variant
 * taking a long as argument is called. <P>
 * 
 * Note that because the enumerated value used for the binding of a
 * buffer object (e.g. GL_ARRAY_BUFFER) is different than that used to
 * query the binding using glGetIntegerv (e.g.
 * GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING), then in the face of new binding targets
 * being added to the GL (e.g. GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_NV) it is
 * impossible to set up a query of the buffer object currently bound
 * to a particular state. It turns out that for some uses, such as
 * finding the size of the currently bound buffer, this doesn't
 * matter, though of course without knowing the buffer object we can't
 * re-associate the queried size with the buffer object ID. <P>
 *
 * Because the namespace of buffer objects is the unsigned integers
 * with 0 reserved by the GL, and because we have to be able to return
 * both 0 and other integers as valid answers from
 * getBoundBufferObject(), we need a second query, which is to ask
 * whether we know the state of the binding for a given target. For
 * "unknown" targets such as GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_NV we return
 * false from this, but we also clear the valid bit and later refresh
 * the binding state if glPushClientAttrib / glPopClientAttrib are
 * called, since we don't want the complexity of tracking stacks of
 * these attributes.
